\chapter{Discussion}

more robust statistical analysis is necessary in this field
- general terrible stats in nafld
   - absolute counts in one paper
  - bad controls (lean vs NASH)
- bad unifrac usage in nafld

recommendations
- compositional data analysis
- look at your data (variance explained, etc.)
- ways to make inferences on data that are not p-value based (like our effect size stuff)

nature statistics biology

summary/conclusion
- we did some methods development and applied it to nafld
- found that many studies in this field cannot be replicated
- made recommendations

field needs some standards like clinical genomics (other fields?)
GWAS studies - reproducibility/batch effects

microbiome standardized way too early, before they knew what they were looking at
- the human microbiome project
- done by ecologists ?
 â€” ecological diversity (one of hte HMP paper in supplementary data, found that diversity indices track how deeply you sequence and tell you nothing else)

- learned as they went along, but were under a tight timeline
